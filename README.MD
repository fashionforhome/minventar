========================

Minventar is a minimalistic in-browser inventory management solution. It is meant as a generic resource management, to allow you to define and manage any types of resources (e.g. IT inventory).

<br>![][4]<br>

You manage your resources by defining your own resource types. 
Resources can be bundles meaning that they can contain any number of resources.

<br>![][5]<br>

Your resources are displayed hierarchically. <br><br>

Minventar uses a MongoDB to store your data. For more information see [Database Schema][3]. <br>

See [Getting started][1] for a guide on how to setup/develop Minventar. <br>

If you want to contribute ideas for improvement see [Upcoming Versions][1].
